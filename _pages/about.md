<!-- > "You Are The Average Of The 5 People You Spend The Most Time With" - Jim Rohn -->
I am a doctoral researcher in the Prof. Zorah Lähner's [Geometry in ML](https://geometryinml.cs.uni-bonn.de/) group. I work on graph representation learning and analysis of latent spaces. Recently I graduated with an MS degree from [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) where I did my thesis with [Prof. Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). 
<br>
I worked on temporal graph learning at [INSIGHT Lab](https://insight.bgu.ac.il/) and 3D scene reconstruction at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) in Tokyo. <b> I am looking for 2026 summer internships in Europe/Asia.</b>

In a previous life, I was an undergraduate student at [IIT Bombay Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) from 2018-2022.

<!-- I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) with Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/curriculum/btechnew#SEM1) and minor in (1) [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and (2) [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->
<!-- Recently I am fascinated and motivated to learn about **geometry and topology-aware representation learning**. I believe that there are lot of symmetries hidden in this world. I am motivated, for the conceivable future (next 10 years) to make this my mission to uncover those symmetries and propose new
applications of artificial intelligence.  -->

<!-- Currently, I am working on my Undergraduate Thesis in the area of Graph Representation Learning and Machine Learning on Structured Data. -->
