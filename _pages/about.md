<!-- > "You Are The Average Of The 5 People You Spend The Most Time With" - Jim Rohn -->
I am a research intern at [INSIGHT Lab](https://insight.bgu.ac.il/) at the [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/). Recently I graduated with an MS degree from [Purdue Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu). Before that I finished an internship at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) in Tokyo, JP in Summer 2024. In a previous life, I was an undergraduate student at [IIT Bombay Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php) from 2018-2022.

<!-- I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) with Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/academics/curriculum/btechnew#SEM1) and minor in (1) [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and (2) [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->
Recently I am fascinated and motivated to learn about **geometry and topology-aware representation learning**. I believe that there are lot of symmetries hidden in this world. I am motivated, for the conceivable future (next 10 years) to make this my mission to uncover those symmetries and propose new
applications of artificial intelligence. The following masterpiece inspires me
> "Everything that happens is as natural as the rose in spring and the crop in summer. Such are disease and death, slander and treachery, and all the rest that delights fools or vexes them."
> 
> — Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*  

Currently I work on physics-inspired methods, primarily using ODEs to advance representation learning for foundation models. I am fortunate to be working with [Dr. Moshe Eliasof](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/team-member/moshe-eliasof), [Prof. Chaim Baskin](https://chaimbaskin.bgu.ac.il/) and [Beatrice Bevilacqua](https://beabevi.github.io/) and [Prof. Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/). I am grateful to [Prof. Abir De](https://abir-de.github.io/) for advising, mentoring and motivating me to do research while I was at IITB. At Sony, I did research on topologically grounded 3D scene generation. I briefly worked on LLMs for supply chain optimization with [Prof. Can Li](https://canli1.github.io/).


<!-- Currently, I am working on my Undergraduate Thesis in the area of Graph Representation Learning and Machine Learning on Structured Data. -->
