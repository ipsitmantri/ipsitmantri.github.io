  abstract  = {Models for the processes by which ideas and influence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains, including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations, the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of "word of mouth" in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

  abstract  = {Viral marketing takes advantage of networks of influence among customers to inexpensively achieve large changes in behavior. Our research seeks to put it on a firmer footing by mining these networks from data, building probabilistic models of them, and using these models to choose the best viral marketing plan. Knowledge-sharing sites, where customers review products and advise each other, are a fertile source for this type of data mining. In this paper we extend our previous techniques, achieving a large reduction in computational cost, and apply them to data from a knowledge-sharing site. We optimize the amount of marketing funds spent on each customer, rather than just making a binary decision on whether to market to him. We take into account the fact that knowledge of the network is partial, and that gathering that knowledge can itself have a cost. Our results show the robustness and utility of our approach.},

  abstract    = {Influence maximization (IM) refers to the problem of finding a subset of nodes in a network through which we could maximize our reach to other nodes in the network. This set is often called the "seed set", and its constituent nodes maximize the social diffusion process. IM has previously been studied in various settings, including under a time deadline, subject to constraints such as that of budget or coverage, and even subject to measures other than the centrality of nodes. The solution approach has generally been to prove that the objective function is submodular, or has a submodular proxy, and thus has a close greedy approximation. In this paper, we explore a variant of the IM problem where we wish to reach out to and maximize the probability of infection of a small subset of bounded capacity K. We show that this problem does not exhibit the same submodular guarantees as the original IM problem, for which we resort to the theory of gamma-weakly submodular functions. Subsequently, we develop a greedy algorithm that maximizes our objective despite the lack of submodularity. We also develop a suitable learning model that out-competes baselines on the task of predicting the top-K infected nodes, given a seed set as input.},
